# RocheHackathon
Repo for all the work we do for the Roche_ZHAW Hackathon 2023

## Goal's for next week
- All individually go through the data. How many missing values? What are the most import features (non-invasive) that help to predict sepsis?

## Main goal:
- Create a model for a non-invasive data to predict prediction of sepsis. We want as few false negatives as possible. Consequently, based on some threshold, we determine whether blood should be taken. We can also try to create a model that uses blood data as input and predicts sepsis (need to see if the data is good enough).

## Instructions for github:
- git clone the repo
- create your own branch with git checkout -b <yourname>; git push -u <branchname> to put it on github
